# Makefile Syntax

A Makefile consists of a set of rules. A rule generally looks like this:

```Makefile
targets: prerequisites
	command
	command
	command
```

* The targets are file names, separated by spaces. Typically, there is only one per rule.
* The commands are a series of steps typically used to make the target(s). These need to start with a tab character, not spaces.
* The prerequisites are also file names, separated by spaces. These files need to exist before the commands for the target are run. These are also called dependencies
